# Cluetastrophe-RPG-Game

The project was created using Unity for game development, C# and Microsoft Visual Studio for coding, and open-source graphics. 
Collaborators: Rawan El-Moghrabi, Maisie Harrington, Linah Al-Jarad, Sanah Pallithotungal

The Unity game project is based on an undercover spy (protagonist) from the CIA, whose partner was abruptly killed by a member of the mafia. The spy is on a hunt to capture the one responsible for the murder. The CIA has concluded that there are three murder suspects, and thus the spy is sent to find clues located at the scene of the crime, an abandoned factory. However, this mission does come with its difficulties. The mafia has sent their troops to the factory to try to stop the spy from identifying the murder. Now, it is up to the spy to use his combat skills to fight them off, while also searching for clues to solve the mystery. 

Character customization: The player has the freedom to choose between a male and female spy in this game.

The 2D platform game will have three different levels that the player must go through. Each level will look remotely different from the other to emphasize a change of settings. All the
assets were designed using open source graphics. The background, the floor and the background objects (not interactive) were obtained from a tile template from the Unity Asset Store. The tiles
were arranged by us to create our three levels. The character, enemies, and interactive objects were imported as assets from google images.

In each level, the player will be presented with enemies that must be defeated. Defeating the enemies will result in character progression (described below). In order to defeat enemies, the
played must use their current abilities to fight them off. The player loses if the enemies kill them. This is done when the enemy touches the spy, whilst the spy is not defending themselves
(punching or shooting).

Enemies: Enemies will be spawned at random locations at random time intervals whilst the player remains in the level. In levels 1 and 2, the enemies will be confined to specific walking
area, and in level 3 their movements will target the player for increased difficulty. Initially one enemy takes 4 punches to be defeated and removed from the game.
To advance to the next level, the character must find all the clues within the level. In every level there will be 3 clues for the player to collect. The player will be provided with a
counter that keeps track of the number of clues found. There will be a lot of items to look through for clues; the player is allowed to search 5 items for clues. If the player searches more
than 5 items, 2 XP points will be deducted per item searched.

To pick-up clues, the character must stand over the item they wish to search and press the F-key. If a clue lies within the item, a message will appear on the screen informing the player
about the clue they have found. 

Level 1: This stage would allow the character to explore the environment and look for clues that will help him find the murderer. The player will also get to practice using their defense 
mechanisms to fight off any approaching enemies. When he finds all the required clues, the player will be loaded into a new room which will begin Level 2.

Level 2: The main character will continue to find clues, interact with objects, and defeat enemies, but one of the clues will be protected by a puzzle in order to be unlocked. There will be a puzzle
that requires players to count the number of shapes hidden around the level and the result is a numeric code that unlocks the clue.

Level 3: In this stage, the main character resumes their previous tasks, however, there will be an added difficulty and an increased number of puzzles.
Puzzle example: unscramble the letters spread around the room to make a word that will unlock the clue.

After all the clues are found, the player will be presented with 3 suspects. With a 2-minute timer, the player must select who they suspect to be the murder based on the clues they collected. If
correct, the player is successful and wins the game.

Character Progression: Every time the player beats an enemy, he earns XP points. Whenever he completes a progression, he is given a character upgrade. Each enemy is worth 5 points. For
progression 1, players would require 50 points and they would earn additional strength. This would allow for an enemy to be defeated in just 2 punches, rather than the initial 4. For
progression 2, players would require 100 points to progress and gain access to the use of a gun to defeat their enemies.

Progression Measure: there will be a progression bar that keeps track of the XP points the character received.
